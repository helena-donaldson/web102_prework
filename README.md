* [X] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

I had two additional features: 
1. I added the recommended anchor tag that allows users to travel to the "Our Games" section by simply clicking a link in the top navigation bar.
2. I added some extra CSS styling for the top nav/header bar to make it look nicer.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

No huge challenges- I found this to be a pretty great review for
JavaScript. I hadn't ever used the reduce method in Javascript
before, so that was especially helpful!
